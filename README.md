# COVID-19-Data-Exploration

## Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on global health, economies, and daily life. Understanding the spread, impact, and trends of COVID-19 is crucial for public health planning and response. This project aims to explore and analyze COVID-19 data using SQL to uncover insights and trends from the pandemic data.

## Dataset

This project utilizes data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), covering the period from January 3, 2020, to September 13, 2023. The analysis is performed using Microsoft SQL Server, leveraging various SQL queries to extract meaningful information from the dataset.

## Data Exploration

The SQL file (Covid' 19 Data Exploration.sql) includes various queries to explore the COVID-19 dataset. The key areas of exploration include:

- Total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths by country
- Trends and patterns in COVID-19 cases and deaths over time
- Comparative analysis of COVID-19 impacts across different regions
- Mortality rates and other key metrics

## Analysis

The analysis involves several SQL queries that perform the following tasks:

- Filtering and cleaning the data
- Aggregating data to generate summary statistics
- Joining tables to combine relevant information
- Using window functions to calculate rolling averages and other time-based metrics
- Creating views to simplify complex queries


## Results

The results of the data exploration provide insights into the spread and impact of COVID-19 across different countries and time periods. Key findings include:

- Temporal trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths
- Geographic hotspots with the highest number of cases and deaths
- Effectiveness of different countries' responses to the pandemic
